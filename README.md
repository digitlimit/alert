> Version 2.0

Alert is Laravel package for displaying different types of messages in Laravel application views.
It's designed to make flashing messages in Laravel Applications a breeze, with a lot of easy to use and fluent methods.

## Quick Start

1. Install Alert with composer:

```
composer require digitlimit/alert
```

2. Somewhere in the blade template

```
<x-alert-normal />
```

Example:

```
@extends('layouts.default')

@section('content')
  <div class="container-xxl flex-grow-1 container-p-y">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <x-alert-normal />
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      @include('form.profile')
    </div>        
  </div>

  @include('partials.footer')
@endsection
```

NB: At the moment the alert components are built with Twitter Bootstrap 5, and can be customized to use other CSS classes.
Need to ensure bootstrap is included on the page.

3. Somewhere in the application

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Alert;

class DashboardController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        Alert::message('Welcome! Please complete your profile')
            ->info()
            ->flash();

        return view('home');
    }
}
```

4. Result
