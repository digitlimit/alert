## Versioning

Alert will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered
with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

For more information on SemVer, please visit https://semver.org.

**The major version "6" is part of an umbrella release.  It includes many different types of files and technologies. Therefore
we deviate from normal SemVer in the following ways:**

* Any release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing
  icon
* We will never intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks
  backward compatibility
* A `minor` release **may include backward-incompatible changes** but we will
  write clear upgrading instructions in UPGRADING.md
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove icons
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they include backward
  incompatibility then they will be `minor` releases

## License

Alert Free is free, open source, and GPL friendly. You can use it for
commercial projects, open source projects, or really almost whatever you want.

- Code â€” MIT License
  - In the Alert Free download, the MIT license applies all PHP files.

We've kept attribution comments terse, so we ask that you do not actively work
to remove them from files, especially code. They're a great way for folks to
learn about Alert.
